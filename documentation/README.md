# bt-cc-model

Includes documentation for varying code segments and setups.

So far:

- cc-de-models, setup and properties
- ovsNetwork, setup of network with virtual switch
- mininetVM, setup of mininetVM used for cc-de-models mininet experiments
- emulabExperiment, structure of a single experiment on emulab hardware

~The code for the emulab network is placed in a seperate repository since it needs to be public to be downloaded and run by the experiment e.g. on startup. [Code](https://github.com/cabart/bt-cc-model-code)~ -> will be changed soon and integrated into this repo
